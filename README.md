A simple emulator for the original GameBoy (and hopefully CGB too) in C.

Massive WIP, so this project will take time.

So far, I'm focusing on getting all instructions working.

## Work left:
- get all instructions done :white_check_mark:
- get a game to boot :white_check_mark:
- get a boootrom working :white_check_mark:
- pass instruction tests <--- [You are here]
- handle inputs
- handle audio
- get bank switching working

Once it reaches a point where I can test it, i'll use the approach that ends up being faster.


There's a bootrom in this repo, shamelessly sourced from [Hacktix](https://github.com/Hacktix/Bootix)
